# Multi-model ML Platform with Automated Deployment

## Project Overview

**Development Time: 30 Hours**

This expert-level project implements a comprehensive platform for automated machine learning model training, evaluation, selection, and deployment with a focus on CI/CD practices. The platform manages the entire ML lifecycle, from data ingestion to model deployment, with a sophisticated orchestration system.

The system supports multiple model types (including XGBoost and Random Forest) that compete against each other, with automated selection of the best performing model for deployment. It features a robust infrastructure for model versioning, deployment pipeline automation, and serving at scale through both container-based and serverless approaches.

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Git LFS for model storage

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd project3-multi-model-ml-platform
```

2. Set up the local environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start local development services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Initialize local DynamoDB tables:
```bash
python scripts/init_local_dynamo.py
```

5. Set up local SageMaker:
```bash
./scripts/setup_local_sagemaker.sh
```

## Training and Deploying Models Locally

1. Prepare sample data:
```bash
python scripts/prepare_sample_data.py
```

2. Run the feature engineering pipeline:
```bash
python scripts/run_feature_engineering.py --config configs/local.yml
```

3. Train models:
```bash
python scripts/train_models.py --config configs/local.yml --models xgboost,random_forest
```

4. Evaluate and register models:
```bash
python scripts/evaluate_models.py --config configs/local.yml
```

5. Deploy the best model:
```bash
python scripts/deploy_model.py --config configs/local.yml --deployment-type local
```

6. Test the deployed model:
```bash
python scripts/test_model.py --endpoint http://localhost:8080/predict
```

## Deployment to AWS

### Infrastructure Deployment

1. Deploy the infrastructure using AWS CDK:
```bash
cd infrastructure
npm install
cdk deploy --all
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

The platform includes a complete CI/CD pipeline:

1. Commit code to the repository
2. GitHub Actions triggers the build pipeline
3. Tests are run and code is validated
4. New models are trained on sample data
5. Models are evaluated against benchmarks
6. If approved, models are deployed to staging
7. After validation, models are promoted to production

## Model Management

### Model Comparison

The platform automatically compares models based on:
- Accuracy metrics (RMSE, MAE, etc.)
- Inference latency
- Resource utilization
- Explainability scores
- Fairness metrics

### Model Versioning

Each model is versioned with:
- Training data snapshot identifier
- Feature engineering pipeline version
- Hyperparameters
- Dependencies and environment
- Performance metrics

## Monitoring and Operations

- Real-time model performance dashboards
- Drift detection for data and concept drift
- Automatic retraining triggers
- Alert system for performance degradation
- Operational runbooks in `/docs/operations/`

## Automated Experimentation

The platform supports automated experimentation:
- A/B testing infrastructure
- Feature impact analysis
- Hyperparameter sensitivity studies
- Model architecture exploration

## Future Enhancements

1. Add support for deep learning models
2. Implement federated learning capabilities
3. Enhanced fairness and bias detection
4. Automated documentation generation
5. Integration with feature stores like AWS Feature Store
