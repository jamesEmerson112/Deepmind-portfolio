## Project Progression

The three projects represent a natural progression in complexity and development effort:

1. **Project 1 (10 hours)** focuses on a streamlined implementation with core AWS serverless services and basic ML deployment.

2. **Project 2 (20 hours)** builds on these concepts, adding container orchestration, data warehouse technology, and more sophisticated ETL processes.

3. **Project 3 (30 hours)** represents the most advanced implementation with multi-model training, automated evaluation, sophisticated deployment strategies, and full CI/CD integration.

## Common Features Across Projects

- **Infrastructure as Code**: All projects use AWS CDK for deployment
- **Local Development**: Docker and LocalStack for AWS service emulation
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration
- **Monitoring and Alerting**: CloudWatch dashboards and alerts
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive READMEs and architectural diagrams

## Getting Started

Each project contains its own detailed README with setup instructions, architecture diagrams, and usage examples. The READMEs include a breakdown of development time by phase to help you understand the effort involved in each component.
