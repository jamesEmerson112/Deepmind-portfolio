# OrchardHub â€“ Smart Orchard Management Platform

## Project Overview

**Development Time:** 34 Hours
**Complexity Level:** Advanced

OrchardHub is a comprehensive web platform for orchard farms, serving both customers and farm management. It integrates modern web technologies with AI-powered features to enhance the orchard experience, optimize operations, and provide valuable insights for business decision-making.

---

## Key Objectives

- Create an attractive, responsive website for customers to learn about the orchard, products, and services
- Implement a sophisticated inventory and harvest management system for farm operators
- Develop an AI-powered crop forecasting and management tool using weather data and historical harvests
- Build a customer portal for ordering produce, scheduling orchard visits, and managing preferences
- Create a comprehensive analytics dashboard for business intelligence
- Implement IoT integration for farm sensors (soil moisture, temperature, etc.)
